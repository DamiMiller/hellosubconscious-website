        <p>
          When I was 14, I experienced my first miracle. I was on a trip with my science teacher, and a girl in our group was terrified of heights—shivering, shaking, and crying. Ten minutes later, I watched in awe as that same girl willingly and confidently rappelled down a 120-foot cliff. The cause of this transformation? My teacher had used hypnosis to help her overcome her fear.

        <p>
          Witnessing that powerful cure was a pivotal moment. I began to devour every book I could find on hypnosis. That single event ignited a lifelong passion and set me on a path to understand the incredible power of the subconscious mind. This is more than a job; it's the calling that found me that day on the cliff.

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text-base mt-10 mb-4">A Foundation of Expertise</h3>
        <p>
          My passion for this work is backed by extensive, world-class training. I am a Certified Clinical Hypnotherapist with the American Council of Hypnotist Examiners (ACHE)—the highest level of certification awarded, requiring over 300 hours of classroom training. My studies have taken me across the globe, learning Emotional Clearing with Helen Mitas, "OldPain2Go" with Steven Blake, and even teaching for the son of Dave Elman, a founding father of modern hypnotherapy.
        </p>
        <p>
          This knowledge has been proven in practice, from performing hypnosis-assisted surgeries to my work being featured in publications like PHL Metropolis. As a Master Practitioner of PSYCH-K®, I've deepened my understanding of belief change. All of these experiences have culminated in the development of my own unique methodology: **The Hello Subconscious System**, a powerful framework that allows anyone to easily and directly work with their own subconscious, without needing a hypnotherapist.
